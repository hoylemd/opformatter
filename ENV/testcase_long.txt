TACTICS
During Combat Scourge prefers intimidating opponents
to fighting them. Once in combat, he attempts to attack
from behind, flanking with his allies.
Morale If reduced to 10 hit points or fewer, Scourge flees
and tries to make good his escape. A man who bears
a grudge, Scourge is certain to try to slip dark reaver
powder or oil of taggit into the meal or drink of anyone
who humiliates or injures him when the chance comes.
